The aventure game!

This game is a venture. A venture into the unknown. It's both a crazy, out-of-control coding adventure and a wild text trek. 

It's been fun making this, but it's not coded incredibly well. It just kind of spiraled into insanity last May... maybe someday in the future I'll restart with a plan, but for now this massive chunk of unreadable code is here to stay.


To play: run aventure_game.py, and follow the instructions. Good luck!
